    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mozzarella sticks are very easy to make at home. They're deep-fried until
      golden and crispy on the outside, with melted gooey cheese on the inside.
      They're so good and take just minutes to fry! Try dipping them in a
      marinara sauce!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
    </ul>

      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg
        mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread
        crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack.
        Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.<br />

      </li>
      <li>
        Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks
        into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from
        heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella
        sticks.<br />
